A network attack is an attempt to gain unauthorized access to an organization's  network with the objective of stealing data or perform other malicious activity. 
There are two main types of network attacks:

* Active : Attackers not only get unauthorized access but also modifies data either encrypting or harming it.

Eg - wannacry ransomeware attack

* Types of network attacks - 
  * Endpoint attacks : Gaining access to user devices servers or endpoints without author's permission.
  * Malware attacks : Infecting IT resources with malware allowing attackers to compromise system, steal data and do damage.
  * Vulnerabilities, exploits and attacks : Exploiting vuln in softwares used in organization to sabotage the system.
  * Advanced persistent threats : These are complex multilayered threats which include network attacks but also other types of attacks.

Eg- vsftpd 2.3.4 exploit

DDoS attacks - Denial of service. It is an attempt to make the server go down.
TCP - Normal communication.
UDP - Real time communication.
